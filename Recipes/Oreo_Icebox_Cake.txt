 "Considerations": "6 hour chill time",
 "Ingredients": [
 {
  "Name": "Double stuff Oreo cookies",
  "Amount": "3 Packages",
  "Details": "15 oz each. You will only use 2 1/2 packages. The rest can be used for the crushed cookie topping"
 },
 {
  "Name": "Heavy whipping cream",
  "Amount": "3 cups",
  "Details": ""
 },
 {
  "Name": "Powdered sugar",
  "Amount": "3 tablespoons",
  "Details": ""
 },
 {
  "Name": "Vanilla",
  "Amount": "3 teaspoons",
  "Details": ""
 },
 {
  "Name": "Powdered sugar",
  "Amount": "3 tablespoons",
  "Details": "Optional"

 {

 ],
 "Instructions": ["In a large mixing bowl, beat cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla just until stiff peaks form, about 7-9 minutes.", "In a 13x9 pan or 3-quart dish, add a single layer of Oreos. You may need to break your cookies in half to fit the sides depending on the size of your baking dish. Top with 1/2 of the whipped cream. Repeat layers, ending with whipped cream.","Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or until cookies are softened. For best results chill overnight. [See note for a quicker version].","To serve, top with crushed cookies. Other options include chocolate chips, caramel, or nuts."],
 "Notes": "Homemade whipped cream can be substituted with 24 ounces of whipped topping.",
 "Tips": ["To soften cookies faster, dip each one in milk before placing in dish. Proceed with layers as noted above.", "For the best whipped cream, chill the metal bowl and whisk/beaters in the freezer for 15 minutes before whipping. Beat the heavy cream until medium to medium-stiff peaks form. You can tell they’re stiff when you pull out the whisk and the tip of the cream stands without curling over. Don’t whip past this point or you’ll end up with butter.", "To assemble, layer the cookies in a single layer. Top with whipped cream and repeat several times. I had 3 layers with 2 cups of whipped cream for each layer, but this will depend on the depth of the dish. You can make this in a 13x9 pan or any 3-quart dish. It would also be beautiful in a clear trifle bowl."],
